                    EMDR (Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy) is an exciting form of psychotherapy that has been gaining traction in recent years as a means of <a class = "link" href = "http://www.emdria.org/?2" target = "_blank">
                    treating victims of trauma</a>. It is widely revered for its non-intrusive nature and comparatively short response times. This treatment is fairly new, only emerging <a class = "link" href = "http://www.emdrhap.org/content/what-is-emdr/" target = "_blank">around 25 years ago</a>, but has seen widespread adoption by patients and therapists
                    alike.

                   As mentioned above, EMDR is typically administered in cases in which the patient has undergone a form of trauma. However, it is not stricly limited to cases of trauma, and some success has been observed in
                   patients whose primary medical dilemma is an anxiety or depressive disorder. EMDR is notable for its ability to effectively treat those suffering from

                <br />
                <div class = "section-content" id = 'test5'>
                  First, it important to note that the most effective and safe means of administering the therapy is under the 
                  guidance of a professional who has experience in working with anxiety and trauma treatments. It is advisable to consult 
                  with a professional for several sessions before discussing the utilization of the therapy in an isolated setting. If these conditions are met, the
                  <a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "http://www.ahdi-west.org/effective-treatment-for-ptsd-emdr-therapy-what-is-emdr/">AHDI notes</a> 
                  that one advantage of EMDR is that it can be performed in any situation, even when a therapist is not present.

                <div class = "section-content" id = 'test6'>
                  In order to use this website, you must first select a color, speed, and duration of the square that will be utilized in the EMDR treatment.
                  It is important to pick the fastest speed that you can manage without feeling overwhelmed. Once your session has begun, follow the square back and forth with your eyes while focusing on
                  the primary stressor and your emotions surrounding it. From here, let your mind drift naturally to related topics, taking care to avoid being caught up on one issue 
                  for an extended period of time.

                <div class = "section-content" id = 'test7'>
                    An important note is that in order for EMDR to be effective, you want to get a full range of motion with your eyes. Make sure that you use a screen that is large enough to allow for this (most phone screens won't do the job).
                </div>

                <div class = "section-content" id = 'test8'>
                  Once again, it is not recommended to attempt EMDR therapy without first discussing it with a qualified therapist.

                <div class = "section-content" id = 'test9'>
                  If you are looking for people who specialize in this form of treatment, the EMDR International Association <a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "http://www.emdria.org/search/custom.asp?id=2337">offers a simple tool</a> to streamline this 
                  process. Because EMDR can often be an intense and personal therapy, it is essential to find someone that you feel comfortable confiding in. If an open line of communication
                  cannot be established, the effectiveness of the therapy can suffer as a result.

                  While the cost of therapy may at first seem prohibitively expensive, it is important to realize that there exist several options for easing the financial burden that it has on your life. 
                  The first, and perhaps most important way
                 to do this is to check with your insurance to see if therapy is covered under your program. It is important to get in direct contact with your insurance provider when determining this, as the specifics of different programs can be confusing (some programs may
                 cover a "social worker" but not a therapist, for example).
                </div>

                 <div class = "section-content" id = 'test11'>
                  Another solution is to research information regarding "training clinics" in your area. Generally located in larger universities, these training clinics often offer lower rates
                  as a reflection of the fact that their psychologists are still in the process of being trained. While this may be off-putting to some, it is important to realize that the treatment being employed by those in training is closely monitored and regulated
                  by a professional, thus ensuring a much higher standard of treatment then one might initially anticipate.

                 Additionally, US citizens in a lower income bracket may be eligible for Medicaid, which can help to cover the costs of mental health treatment. You can get information
